# 📚 Purpose of This Website

Welcome to our Homework Helper!

This website is designed to make learning easier and more interactive for school students. Here's how it works:

## ✏️ How It Helps Students

- Every homework sheet you receive has a **QR code** on it.
- When you scan the QR code using your phone or tablet, it brings you right here to this website.
- You'll find **hints, explanations**, and sometimes even **answers** to the questions on that specific sheet.

## 🎯 Our Goal

Our main goal is to **support students in learning**, not just give out answers. The hints and guidance will help you:

- Understand the topic better
- Think critically about the questions
- Build confidence in solving problems on your own

## 🧠 Learn Smarter

Instead of feeling stuck or waiting for help, you can get instant support anytime by just scanning the code. Learning becomes:

- Faster ✅  
- Smarter ✅  
- More enjoyable ✅

Keep learning, keep growing — and remember, it's okay to ask for help!
